# myartpage, a personal web page system for artists
This is a content management system primarily for artists looking to build and host a personal website for their art.

> [!CAUTION]
> This project is currently under development and not yet usable.

## Why am I building this?
I make comics myself — see e.g. [Treehouse on Tapas](https://tapas.io/series/Treehouse) — but publishing art on platforms is restrictive in many ways.
Popular comics platforms, like Tapas, are built for the vertical scrolling (webtoon) format, but I draw mine for the double paged (book) format and would like for my readers to experience them as such.

At the same time, I yearn in general for having a _home_ on the web that's truly my own[^1].
The modern web is owned by corporations, and one's space there feels rented.
Personal web / indie web / small web is a concept I really like and want to be part of.

Obviously, existing tools for building websites already exist, but they don't quite cut it for me.
So, why not make something that'll be fun to build and might benefit others once it's done?
